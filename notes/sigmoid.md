The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is a type of activation function commonly used in machine learning, particularly in binary classification problems. The function maps any input into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of the input belonging to the positive class in a binary classification problem.

### Mathematical Representation

The sigmoid function \( \sigma(x) \) is defined as:

\[
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\]

### Properties

- **Output Range**: \( (0, 1) \)
- **Smooth Gradient**: Has a smooth slope, making it easier to compute gradients for backpropagation.
- **Monotonic**: It's an increasing function, meaning that an increase in the input will result in an increase in the output.

### Advantages

- Easy to implement.
- Output values are in the range \( (0, 1) \), convenient for probability interpretation.

### Disadvantages

- **Vanishing Gradient Problem**: For extreme values of the input, the function saturates, meaning the gradient is close to zero. This slows down the learning.
- **Not Zero-Centered**: The output is not zero-centered, which can be problematic in some scenarios.

### Usage in Keras

In Keras, you can specify the sigmoid activation function using the `activation` argument in layers like so:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=8, activation='sigmoid'))
```

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Library**: TensorFlow/Keras for neural network implementation
- **Other Tools**: NumPy for numerical calculations

The sigmoid function is widely used, but it's essential to understand its limitations, particularly the vanishing gradient problem, to decide if it's the right choice for a given application.
